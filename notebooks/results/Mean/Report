# Project Results

## 1. Quantitative Analysis
We performed 15 runs to compare the Few-Shot model against the Baseline.

* **Baseline Mean Score:** 0.4251
* **Few-Shot Mean Score:** 0.4326

The Few-Shot model showed a consistent improvement of approximately 1.76%.

## 2. Visualization
The graph below demonstrates the stability of the Few-Shot model across the testing steps:
